using Random
"""
parity_check_matrix(n, wr, wc)

Computes a regular LDPC matrix using Callager's algorithm

Block is created initially and then the columns are randomly
permuted to create additional parity check n_equations

# Arguments
* `n`: The length of the code
* `wr`: Row weight (Number of bits a parity check equations acts upon). Must divide n
* `wc`: Column weight (Number of parity check equations for a given bit)

# Examples
```julia
julia> using LDPC
julia> H = parity_check_matrix(1000, 10, 9)
```
